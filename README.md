# Awesome Grok Bots

[![Bots](https://img.shields.io/badge/bots-297-2563eb?style=flat-square)](#categories)
[![Updated November 4, 2026](https://img.shields.io/badge/updated-2026--11--04-64748b?style=flat-square)](CHANGELOG.md)

A curated list of **297** third-party Grok Bots. Privacy and cleanup come first: people-search removals, spam, inboxes, and old posts. The rest cover security, home network, money, shopping, productivity, and everyday life.

These bots are unofficial and third-party. They are not made or endorsed by xAI. Review each bot before you add it. Most ask before they send email, file a form, delete, or block anything.

Counts and category pages are generated from [`data/bots.yaml`](data/bots.yaml). Guides below cover stacks, using bots together, tips, best practices, and where to find more.
